# coutils
Contains some C++20 coroutine utilities involving no platform I/O.  
It is assumed that all coroutine functinalities in C++20 standard is supported (and behaves as described in [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines)), and the coroutine header is `<coroutine>` instead of `<experimental/coroutine>`.  
Currently WIP, published for usage in other projects.
